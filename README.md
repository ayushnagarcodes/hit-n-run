# Hit'N'Run
- It's a 2D game developed in Unity engine. Hit the enemies, score points and run to save your life as far as you can (^_^)...
- Feels like a 90s console game (thanks to unity's inbuilt post processing package).
- You can play the game:
  - In browser (click [here](https://ayushnagarcodes.github.io/HitNRun/))
  - By installing the executable (only available for windows 64-bit) (click [here](https://github.com/ayushnagarcodes/HitNRun/raw/main/Hit'N'Run%20Setup%20(x64).exe) or download the .exe from above)
- Features:
  - UI screen when the game starts. Click on "Play" to enjoy the game or "Exit" to quit.
  - Hit enemies with bullets (point your mouse cursor in the enemy direction and shoot with left mouse button).
  - You must move your player with the arrow keys to avoid colliding with enemies (otherwise game over! and your score is reset to 0).
  - The enemy AI spawns randomly, so you don't know where it is coming from.
  - Speed of enemy AI and their spawn rate increases with time, so it becomes difficult to survive.
  - Post-processing effects to give it a vintage look.
  - You can reload (press "R") or go to main menu (press "Tab").
  - Stores your highscore so that you can beat it again.
